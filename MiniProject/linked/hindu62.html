A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_bomber">suicide bomber</a> blew himself up outside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul">Kabul</a> restaurant filled with foreigners and affluent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan">Afghan</a>s, while two gunmen snuck in through the back door and opened fire Friday in a brazen dinnertime attack that killed 16 people, officials said. 

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban">Taliban</a> claimed responsibility within an hour of the attack against La Taverna du Liban, part of a stepped-up campaign of violence against foreign and government interests to send a message that the militants are not going anywhere as the U.S.-led coalition winds down its combat mission at the end of the year. The bombing served as a reminder that although militant violence in the capital has dropped off in recent months, insurgents remain capable of carrying out attacks inside the most heavily guarded areas. 

Security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to release the information, said the assault began with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_bomber">suicide bomber</a> detonating his explosives at the front door of the restaurant, located in an area housing several embassies, non-governmental organisations and the homes and offices of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan">Afghan</a> officials. As chaos ensued, the two other attackers entered through the kitchen and began shooting. They were later killed by security guards, said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi. 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul">Kabul</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_chief">police chief</a> Gen. Mohammad Zahir Zahir said the 16 people killed were all inside the restaurant. He said foreigners and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan">Afghan</a>s were among the dead, but he did not provide a breakdown. Officials said at least four other people were wounded.
